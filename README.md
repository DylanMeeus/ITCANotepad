# ITCANotepad
Repository for the itca notepad project.

Hosted on http://www.it-ca.net/notepad
----------------------------------------

What is it-ca.net/notepad?
===============
The idea for this project was simple. Create a website that allows user who play games using steam, to quickly create notes whilst in-game. That was the basic idea, however as people started using this and requests came in for additions, the project grew in scope and ability.
At this moment, it offers the ability to create multiple notes, some account management, and sharing notes between accounts. 
Whilst this is beyond the original scope of the project, this still runs on the steam-browser even on throttled systems.
